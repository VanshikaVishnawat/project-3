            This year marks the 10th International Day of Yoga with the theme "Yoga for Women's Empowerment." The goal is to transform yoga into a widespread movement that emphasizes women’s well-being and promotes global health and peace.

Female empowerment aims to create a society where all women can make their own choices and act with confidence. Regular yoga practice helps women not only tone their bodies but also cultivate mental resilience and determination, empowering them at various stages of their lives. Yoga's focus on mindful breathing, meditation, and gentle movement helps calm the nervous system, lower stress hormone levels, and promote a sense of inner peace. Regular practice fosters mental well-being and emotional resilience.

Yoga is an ancient physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in India. The word ‘yoga’ derives from Sanskrit and means to join or unite, symbolizing the union of body and consciousness.

Today, yoga is practiced in various forms around the world and continues to grow in popularity.

Recognizing its universal appeal, on December 11, 2014, the United Nations proclaimed June 21 as the International Day of Yoga by resolution 69/131.

The International Day of Yoga aims to raise awareness worldwide of the many benefits of practicing yoga.

The draft resolution establishing the International Day of Yoga was proposed by India and endorsed by a record 175 member states. The proposal was first introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address during the opening of the 69th session of the General Assembly, in which he said: “Yoga is an invaluable gift from our ancient tradition. Yoga embodies unity of mind and body, thought and action ... a holistic approach [that] is valuable to our health and our well-being. Yoga is not just about exercise; it is a way to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world, and nature.”

The resolution notes “the importance of individuals and populations making healthier choices and following lifestyle patterns that foster good health.” In this regard, the World Health Organization has also urged its member states to help their citizens reduce physical inactivity, which is among the top ten leading causes of death worldwide and a key risk factor for non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes.

But yoga is more than a physical activity. In the words of one of its most famous practitioners, the late B. K. S. Iyengar, “Yoga cultivates the ways of maintaining a balanced attitude in day-to-day life and endows skill in the performance of one’s actions.”
